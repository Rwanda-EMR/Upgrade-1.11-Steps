1. Import the 1.11 databases
2. Start OpenMRS 2.3.3 (...with all the modules) on the 1.11 database to have it upgraded
3. Source the global properties backup file (...it has no drop table and uses REPLACE INTO instead of INSERT INTO)
4. Source the metadata backup file (...it has no drop table and uses REPLACE INTO instead of INSERT INTO)
5. Run the post migration script (...it is a modified version of the post migration scrip used to upgrade OpenMRS 1.9)

6. If the Regimen portlet refuses to load, run the following query to see if there are drugs that are pointing to non existing concepts

   select concept_id from drug where concept_id not in (select concept_id from concept);

mysql> select concept_id,name from drug where concept_id not in (select concept_id from concept);
+------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| concept_id | name                                               |
+------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|       8863 | FORLAX PDER SACHET 10g                             |
|       8936 | OTIPAX GOUTTES AURICULAIRES (PHENASONE+LIDOCAINE)  |
+------------+----------------------------------------------------+

7. Search for the actual concepts and use their IDs to update the drugs

mysql> update drug set concept_id = 8862 where drug_id = 663;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0,10 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

mysql> update drug set concept_id = 11176 where drug_id = 764;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0,15 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

8. For order extension module to sart, execute the following query and uplaod a new version of the orderextension module
   
   delete from liquibasechangelog where ID like 'orderextension%';
   
   Then restart tomcat (sudo service tomcat8 restart)
